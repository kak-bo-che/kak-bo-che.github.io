Over the next few years I'm going to be trying to accumulate 1000 hours of Computer Numeric Control (CNC) experience. CNC Experience will cover everything related to CNC including, but not limited to CAD, CAM, Machine Time, Dust Extaction, control software and many other topics. I'm going to be recording the amount of time I spend in each post. The posts will sometimes be a short description of what I did and other times more detail explainations with instructions that can be followed.
