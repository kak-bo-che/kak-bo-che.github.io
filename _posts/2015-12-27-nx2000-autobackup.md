# Making the NX2000 useful
Over a year ago I bought a NX2000 to put in an enclosure outside and use as a weather camera. Unfortunately, The camera can't be powered by USB and operate at the same time, which completely destroyed its ability to be used for that purpose. Since the camera runs Linux I assumed it would be easy to automate uploading of pictures as well as have it take an image every minute or so. After digging through the source posted by samsung for the camera I couldn't make heads or tails of how it actually worked so I set the camera aside for the last year.
Recently I decided I wanted to use the camera to document projects, but in order for that to work the process of getting the images into my github page would have to be no more difficult than the images taken with my phone. Turns out other people have figured out how to automate camera uploads from the phone not using Samsung's cumbersome software. I basically just took the scripts written by jdieter, added my ssh keys and everything worked.
