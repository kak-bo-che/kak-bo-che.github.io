# DA61-01805
My uncle came to me with a broken part from his refrigerator's ice maker. The part had been discontinued and no replacement part is available. He gave me the broken part to make a model of it and then hopefully 3D print. I decided to design a part
for the laser cutter instead because it is much faster and easier to model 2.5D parts.
I also briefly looked for the [replacement part](http://www.samsungparts.com/Products/Parts_and_Accessories/PID-DA61-01805A.aspx) just in case and was unable to find it initially...

Since this was a one off part design I used [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c7a44e49f0d14bc0aeb10127/w/ea9db35f20d34f6f8de18bc5/e/33992b1e623c4f7ca247fada) to design a part that would work roughly the same way.
According to my uncle the piece was simply screwed in place. After examining the broken piece it appeared to be have a tapered hole that would be locked in place with the screw on the end. I designed several layers of acrylic that would approximate the taper.

Before fabricating the part I decided to find examples of how it is mounted to the ice maker. In doing so I uncovered that the taper was not used at all and instead the arm mount is keyed on one side and locks in place with a screw. After discovering this I realized without an example part I wouldn't be able to fabricate a replacement. I began to look for similar parts that had the same keyed mounting hole and I found one, [DA61-00524A](http://www.appliancepartspros.com/samsung-guide-da61-00524a-ap4140430.html), that looks to be a direct replacement for the broken one.

Sometimes its better to just look harder for a replacement part instead of making one.
