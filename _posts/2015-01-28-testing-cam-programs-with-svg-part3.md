For Previous experiments see:

* [part one]({% post_url 2015-01-22-testing-cam-programs-with-svg %}).
* [part two]({% post_url 2015-01-27-testing-cam-programs-with-svg-part2 %})

Today I'll be using [JSCut](http://jscut.org) Like the previous two CAM programs this one is also free and browser based. Months ago JSCut was the first CAM program I tried to use and all of the options didn't mean anything to me and I gave up almost immediately. JSCut seems to have more options available than MakerCAM or Easel, but maybe that is just because they are always visible. 

## JSCut Steps
1. Operations => Select px per inch
2. Tool => Units (mm)
3. Tool => Pass Depth (1.5)
4. Open SVG => local file
5. Material => Units (mm)
6. Material => Thickness (5)
7. Edit ToolPaths => Select Square
8. Create Operation => Outside
9. Create Operation => Deep (5)
10. Operations => Generate
11. Save GCode

## OpenSCAM
Looks good, although by default the tool begins not at the origin.

# Resulting GCODE
Four times as long as Easel and 8 times as long as MakerCAM!
