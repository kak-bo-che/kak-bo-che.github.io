## Jet Dust Collector
Since I plan on getting a CNC machine I felt that dust collection is a requirement. I had read way too much related to dust collection on the [Bill Pentz Site](http://billpentz.com/woodworking/cyclone/index.cfm) realizing that whatever I plan to do for my little garage it will likely be too little to actually help out with the fine dust floating through the air. In the end I decided something is better than nothing and a two stage cycle system is fairly cheap to setup if you buy the parts from various vendors.  

I got my Jet Dust collector as a $140 craigslist special that I had to drive one hour there and back for. It is a well known 1.5 HP DC1100. From the factory the bags on the collector are 30 Micron which are useless for the control of fine dust, which is dangerous to your lungs. The craigslist special had after market 1 Micron bags which are much better but they really didn't seem to fit the collector terribly well. It also included a 'cyclone' [trash can lid](http://www.leevalley.com/US/wood/page.aspx?cat=1,42401&p=30282) which sort of work but not really.

I also bought a [Super Dust Deputy](http://www.oneida-air.com/inventoryd.asp?item_no=SCOLLECT43) to connect the Jet Blower to. 

Someone also sold me a 32 gallon fiber container that I intend on using on the bottom of the cyclone for chip/dust collection.

I'm in the middle of coming up with what to do with the dust collector, but my end goal is to hang it on the wall with a cyclone beneath it. To do this I have to design a bracket for the collector and the cyclone, come up with a way to connect it to the 32 gallon container, also replace the two bags with a single air filter cartridge that I haven't purchased yet. 

## Wall Mount
I haven't gotten terribly far designing the wall mount, but this ![Sketchup Model](/images/{{ page.date | date:"%Y-%m-%d" }}/dust_collector_mount.jpg) is what I've come up with so far based on a design I saw doing a google images search for dust collector wall mount.
