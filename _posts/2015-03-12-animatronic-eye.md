## !!!This post will be updated as more progress is made
Five Nights at Freddy's is a popular game that has made my son terrified of animatronic robots, which has inspired me to make a pair of animatronic eyes to help him overcome his fear :)

This isn't going to really be a tutorial or anything just some experiments with my 3d printer, onshape, servos, arduino, and others.

## Hacktastic version 1.0 (Ping Pong Balls and Plywood)
My first quick attempt was to use some basic materials that were hanging around. This stuff obviously isn't related to CNC but it was an attempt to work through ideas and see what problems arise.

### Issues
* it is really hard to drill holes in pvc at 90 degree intervals
* mounting bracket screw holes are too close and it is impossible to put two bolts in
* it is best to use a sharp blade to cut the ping pong balls instead of trying to drill them

## [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/)
I requested an invite to OnShape beta as soon as I heard about it from the blog on [CNC Cookbook](http://blog.cnccookbook.com/2015/03/06/keep-eyes-peeled-onshape-next-generation-cad-software/). It works, but I'm not very good at CAD.

This is my first attempt for an eye holder the mistake I made was the pvc pipe just fits into the opening so there is no way I can make a gimbal
